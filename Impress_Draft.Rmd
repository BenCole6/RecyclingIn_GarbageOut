# Recycling In, Garbage Out

## The Idea

- 416 recycling litter bins in Melbourne
- 2897 other litter bins
- Recycling bins strategically placed
- What if every public litter bin could accept recycling?

## Increasing Recycling, Reducing Waste

- Use image recognition on every public litter bin to recognise recycling
- Increase number of recycling litter bins around CBD

## How it Works

- Two cameras, images and infrared
- Image recognition for detecting object type - eg coffee cup, plastic bottle, etc
    - machine learning image recognition
- Infrared for detecting food spoilage
    - methane emissions

## Gamifying Recycling

- Two LED light units on every bin, with matching colours to bin signage
- Audible tone played
- Hold item in front of bin for a second to allow image recognition
- Bin lights up and plays a tone to match recycling type
    - accessible to both hearing or vision impaired persons

## Take it Home

- App for your phone
- Scan item with phone's camera
- Screen changes colours and plays a tone to match whether the item is recyclable
- "I need your help" for items it can't recognise
    - add images to data bank for image recognition, the model grows

### Show and Tell

- Also can be used in schools to teach good recycling habits

## Waste to Landfill Reduction
